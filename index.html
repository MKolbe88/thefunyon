        <p>An advanced AI named, Calc-U-Later, was tasked to win a tic-tac-toe tounament. 64 participants from all over
            California, to risk blood, sweat, and tears. The matches were long and strenuous, but there always has to be
            a winner. After winning every match, Calc-U-Later was set for the championship versus Jack White, 10 years
            old and 6 time champion. Calc-U-Later did its best, but came up short in 3 straight games. Guess someone has
            some explaining to do.</p>

        <p id="para">Leading researchers at Harvard just released a study correlating tin-foil hats and a boost in IQ.
            Cheif Reseaarcher, Nathan Johnson, states, "...because we emit brain waves. The tin-foil has a reflective
            barrier that causes the brain waves to return to it's origin. Those brain-waves escaping are making people
            dumber, turning them into giggling bafoons...". So, wear your Tin-Foil hats and get that IQ up! Also,
            remember, people who don't wear a TF hat and are laughing, aren't being rude. When they hold up an "L" to
            their forehead, they are only saying "Looking Good!"</p>
